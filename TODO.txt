TILING WM
=========

* Preconfigured layout support, like Mosaic:
	* A "layout" is a covering of the screen area with rectangles
	* A layout is created by horiz and vert splitting of screen
	* Layouts have names, and are preconfigured

	* allow setting the current layout
	* allow windows to be placed in cell by hotkeys
	* allow windows to be dragged into a cell

* Like Divvy:
	* Given a window, bring up a mini-map of a grid
	* Allow window to be moved or resized by keyboard (specify NE and SW corners of window by hints)
	* Allow window to be moved or resized by mouse (drag across minimap)

* Like mine:
	* Same as Divvy mouse drag, only across screen, not minimap
