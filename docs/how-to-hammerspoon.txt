[ PRE-REQUISITES ]

* install "Karabiner Elements"
* in Karabiner Elements, add a mapping from CAPSLOCK to F18
* in OSX Keyboard Modifier Preferences panel, disable CAPSLOCK

[ DEFINITIONS ]

* "focused window" = window with keyboard focus, if any (different than
  "top-most" or "under mouse")
* "move" = change location of focused window
* "resize" = change size of focused window
* "place" = change size and location of focused window

[ FEATURES ]

* "drag to move" -- move "window under mouse" as you move the mouse
* "drag to resize" -- resize "window under mouse" as you move the mouse

* "kbd to move" -- use the keyboard to move the focused window
* "kbd to resize" -- use the keyboard to resize the focused window
* "kbd to place" -- use the keyboard to place the focused window

* Hyper-or-Esc

* Highlight Mouse

* Dark Bg -- manually change the brightness of the desktop background

* Mini Preview

[ HYPER-OR-ESC ]

* if `CAPS` is pressed once, by itself, it acts as `ESC`
* if `CAPS` is pressed together with any other key, it acts as a new modifier
  called `Hyper`
* you can bind keys together with Hyper to create kbd hotkeys;
* by default, I define the following hotkeys:
    * `Hyper`-`l` -- activate screensaver ("Lock")
    * `Hyper`-`b` -- launch a new Chrome window ("Browser")
    * `Hyper`-`f` -- launch a new Finder window ("Finder")
    * `Hyper`-`t` -- launch a new iTerm2 window ("Terminal")
    * `Hyper`-`n` -- launch a new Notes window ("Notes")
    * `Hyper`-`k` -- launch a new KeePass window ("Keepass")
    * `Hyper`-`m` -- activate Mini Preview (see "Mini Preview")
    * `Hyper`-`=` -- increase  desktop background brightness (see "Dark Bg")
    * `Hyper`-`-` -- descrease desktop background brightness (see "Dark Bg")

[ HIGHLIGHT MOUSE ]

* draws a red circle around the mouse cursor for a few seconds, making it easy
  to visually locate the mouse cursor
* activate with `CMD`-`CTRL`-`m`

[ DARK-BG ]

* press `Hyper`-`-` to decrease the brightness of the desktop background
* press `Hyper`-`=` to increase the brightness of the desktop background
* brightness is preserved across restarts

[ MINI-PREVIEW ]

* the window under mouse gets "moved out of the way", by being sent to the
  bottom-right corner as screen, as far as possible (only a very small part of
  its border is visible)
* instead, a "mini preview" window appears: a smaller, live-updating version of
  the original window, that is semi-transparent and "always on top"
* you cannot interact with the mini preview window: kbd and mouse events on it
  are discarded rather than being forwarded to the original window; it is a
  view-only, live-updating, smaller version of the original
* you can move and resize the mini preview using "drag to move" and "drag to
  resize"; when resized, mini-preview windows maintain their aspect ratio
* pressing "q" or "x" while hovering over the mini preview closes it, bringing
  back the original window

[ GENERAL DRAG-TO-{MOVE/RESIZE} CONCEPTS ]

* while dragging to move
	* window edges snap to screen edges
	* window edges snap to edges of other window

* while dragging to resize
	* window bottom and right edges snap to screen edges
	* window bottom and right edges snap to screen center
	* window bottom and right edges snap to edges of other windows

* limit to one axis:
	* hold SHIFT while dragging to limit movement / resizing to only one axis

[ DRAG-TO-MOVE ]

* press and hold CMD-CTRL
* with CMD-CTRL pressed, move the mouse around
* the window under the mouse follows the mouse; there is no need to click or
  right-click the mouse, or to "grab" any particular part of the window (title,
  frame, ...)

[ DRAG-TO-RESIZE ]

* press and hold OPTION-CTRL
* with OPTION-CTRL pressed, move the mouse around
* the window under the gets resized, with its bottom-right corner mimicking the
  mouse's movement; there is no need to click or right-click the mouse, or to
  "grab" any particular part of the window

[ NOTE ]

I find those specific key combinations (CMD-CTRL/OPTION-CTRL to move/resize)
particularly convenient, as it takes just a tiny movement of the left thumb to
switch between moving and resizing the window under the mouse, making it fast
and easy to arrange that window "just right".

[ USING THE KEYBOARD TO MOVE WINDOWS ]

* press and hold CMD-CTRL (just like entering "drag to move")
* ... but don't move the mouse
* instead, press the UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT arrow keys to move the focused
  window, snapping its top-left corner to a 16x8 grid

[ USING THE KEYBOARD TO MOVE WINDOWS ]

* press and hold OPTION-CTRL (just like entering "drag to resize")
* ... but don't move the mouse
* instead, press the UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT arrow keys to resize the focused
  window, snapping its bottom-right corner to a 16x8 grid

[ USING THE KEYBOARD TO PLACE WINDOWS ]

* press and hold CMD-CTRL (just like entering "drag to move")
* press one of the keys below to both move and resize the focused window as
  indicated:

    * `1`, `2`, `3` -- place in the {left / middle / right} 1/3rd of the screen
    * `o`, `p`, `l`, `;` -- place in the {left / right} x {top / bottom} 1/4th of the screen
    * `[`, `]` -- place in the {left / right} half of the screen
    * `/` -- maximize
    * `,` -- center (move, without chaning size)
